# A PWA QR Scanner Demo

I created a demo page using [this tutorial](https://paulho1973.medium.com/create-qr-code-scanner-using-react-pwa-97b0b9bc1a73).

For the demo page to function correctly and utilize PWA features, it has been deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). PWA features, such as camera access, require a secure HTTPS connection, which is provided by Vercel's deployment service.

## What does the demo page do?

In this demo, I showcase one way to access a mobile device's camera and scan QR codes using a library called [react-qr-reader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-qr-reader?activeTab=readme) My goal was to demonstrate that it is possible to access a mobile device's camera from a PWA.
